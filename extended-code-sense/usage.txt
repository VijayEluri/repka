Brief Description
PhpStorm plugin that provides some code completion usability enhancements for Php language.

* Suggested code completion pops up automatically after some timeout wherever an identifier is expected in your code.
* The code completion window shows matching "Live Templates" among other completion possibilities.

Installation
* Download the binary (extended-code-sense.jar)
