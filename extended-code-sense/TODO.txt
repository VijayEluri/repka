============
TODO:
 # the code sense should apply to PHP language only;
 - make and use configuration options;
 - when to popup and when do not: detect when we're expecting a variable name.
 #- show "No sugg" if nothing is found (?)
 #- add the "live templates" (use the contributor ext. point)

 - live templates: intermediate match should show all the matching live templates, like "it|" pops up "itar", "itco", etc.
 - looks like a bug: if upon intermediate typing "No suggestions" is shown, the auto-popup does not appear even
   if there are possibilities to do so.
